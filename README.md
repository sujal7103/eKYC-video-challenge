The eKYC Video Challenge repository provides a robust solution for digital identity verification using AI-powered video processing. It offers a comprehensive framework for automating the Know Your Customer (KYC) process through video-based authentication, enhancing security and user experience. This module uses advanced algorithms to analyze video footage, compare it against provided documents, and confirm the authenticity of a person's identity in real-time.

## **Key Features**
- `AI-Powered Face Matching` - Uses facial recognition to verify the identity of users.
- `Real-Time Video Processing` - Ensures seamless and fast verification by processing video footage in real time.
- `Enhanced Security` - Combines multiple layers of verification to prevent fraud and identity theft.

## **Use Cases**
This eKYC module can be implemented in various industries, including:

- Banking and Financial Services: Automating customer onboarding, enhancing security for online banking, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
- Telecommunications: Simplifying the user registration process and preventing fraud in SIM card activation.
- Healthcare: Verifying patient identities for telemedicine services, ensuring secure access to medical records.
- E-Commerce and Online Marketplaces: Verifying buyer and seller identities for enhanced trust and safety.
- Government Services: Enabling secure and efficient access to online public services and benefits.

By using video-based eKYC, businesses can reduce fraud, improve user experience, and meet regulatory requirements for identity verification in digital transactions.
